# About the Artists

Andrzej Olejniczak (saxophone) and Władysław "Adzik" Sendecki (piano) are two titans of Polish jazz whose musical paths have been intertwined for decades. They first made waves in the 1970s, founding the legendary bands Extra Ball and Sunship, the latter considered one of the most important Polish jazz groups of that era. Though their careers took them on separate journeys in the 1980s – Olejniczak to Spain after performing with String Connection, and Sendecki to Germany and Switzerland, becoming a highly sought-after session player collaborating with giants like Billy Cobham, the Brecker brothers, and Jaco Pastorius – they reunited in 1999.

Since then, they have renewed their dynamic collaboration, performing across Europe at prestigious festivals and venues. Their concerts draw heavily on original compositions from both leaders, showcasing a thrilling range from contemporary hard bop to free jazz, enriched with influences from Polish classical, folk, and Spanish music. They are renowned for their instrumental mastery and deep musical connection, praised for Sendecki's "flair and finesse" at the piano and Olejniczak's "fantastically thought-out sounds and improvisations" on the saxophone, all built on a remarkable ability to listen and respond to each other.
