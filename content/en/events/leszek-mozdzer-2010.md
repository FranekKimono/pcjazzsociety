# About Leszek Możdżer

Widely considered Polish Jazz's greatest revelation of the last decade, Leszek Możdżer is an outstanding pianist, composer, and producer. Born in Gdańsk in 1971, he began playing piano at age five and graduated from the Stanisław Moniuszko Academy of Music in Gdańsk in 1996.

His jazz career took off in 1991 with the band Miłość (Love). Voted the Most Promising Musician by _Jazz Forum_ readers in 1993 and 1994, he has been consistently named Best Jazz Pianist since 1994. Initially part of the yass movement, Możdżer is described as "one of the most interesting phenomena" in Polish jazz.

He has collaborated with a vast array of Polish and international stars, including Tomasz Stańko, Anna Maria Jopek, Pat Metheny, David Gilmour, Marcus Miller, and John Scofield. While feeling most at home in solo projects and his trio with Lars Danielsson and Zohar Fresco (whose albums have achieved Diamond and Double Platinum status), Możdżer has recorded over 100 albums.

His work often blends classical and jazz, notably his acclaimed "Impressions On Chopin" (1999). His classical training enables profound improvisational freedom, creating unique musical landscapes with a distinct timbre, eloquence, and harmony that often produce a subtle, mystical atmosphere.

Since 2011, Możdżer has served as the Artistic Director of the Enter Music Festival in Poznań.
