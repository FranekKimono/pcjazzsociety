# About the Band

Founded in 1993 by Polish jazz icon Andrzej Jagodzinski, the trio features Jagodzinski on piano, Adam Cegielski on bass, and Czeslaw "Maly" Bartkowski on drums. Jagodzinski, a graduate of the prestigious Frederick Chopin Conservatory in Warsaw, is renowned for his virtuosic keyboard skills and has played with many of Poland's top jazz groups.

In 1993, the trio recorded the groundbreaking album "Chopin," initiating a decades-long trend of adapting Fryderyk Chopin's music into jazz in Poland. The album earned numerous accolades, including Best CD of 1994 from _Jazz Forum_ readers and the "Fryderyk 1994" Polish Music Award for Best Jazz CD.

Their interpretations of Chopin have been hailed as "one of the best examples of classical jazz since Art Tatum tackled Massenet" (_Music and Media_). Beyond Chopin, the trio has masterfully transformed Bach's compositions and Polish traditional music into the jazz idiom, often collaborating with chamber orchestras and soloists.

Since its formation, the Andrzej Jagodzinski Trio has performed at prestigious venues and festivals worldwide, from Jazz Jamboree in Poland to Carnegie Hall in New York and the Great Hall of Moscow Conservatory. Their celebrated discography includes multiple Gold Disc-status albums in Poland, solidifying their role as ambassadors of Polish jazz who seamlessly blend classical influences with improvisation.
