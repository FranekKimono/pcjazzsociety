# About the Band

## Arntzen's Three Generation Dixieland Band

This unique family jazz ensemble showcases the musical legacy of the Arntzen family across three generations of New Orleans-style jazz performers.

Led by patriarch Lloyd Arntzen (clarinet, vocals, soprano sax), one of the founding fathers of Vancouver's traditional jazz scene and a B.C. Entertainment Hall of Fame inductee, the band embodies a rich musical heritage. Lloyd began performing at age three and has been a central figure in Vancouver jazz since the 1950s.

The band features Lloyd alongside his sons Tom and Leif, and grandsons Evan and Miles, all accomplished musicians. While this core group forms the band, other family members often join, making each performance a unique family gathering.

Their music, deeply rooted in the New Orleans tradition, is characterized by melodic, swinging tunes. They have released live recordings, such as "3 Generations in Jazz," and are celebrated fixtures at events like the Vancouver Hot Jazz Festival and previous Polish Canadian Jazz Society Jazz Balls. The Arntzen family's dedication to traditional jazz has been passed down through generations, starting in Lloyd's own living room, which served as the family rehearsal space.
