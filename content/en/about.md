# About Us: Celebrating Polish and Canadian Jazz

Welcome to the home of the Polish Canadian Jazz Festival! We are a passionate organization dedicated to bringing the vibrant rhythms of Polish and Canadian jazz to the heart of Vancouver. Founded by a group of jazz enthusiasts and members of the Polish-Canadian community, our mission is to foster cultural exchange, showcase outstanding musical talent, and create unforgettable live music experiences.

We believe in the power of jazz to connect people, transcend borders, and enrich our society. Our festival and year-round activities aim to celebrate the rich heritage of Polish jazz and its dynamic interplay with the Canadian music scene.
