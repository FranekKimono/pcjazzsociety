# About the Trios

## Piotr Wyleżoł Trio

Led by the outstanding pianist and composer Piotr Wyleżoł, this trio is a prominent force in the European jazz scene. Wyleżoł, a professor at the Academy of Music in Kraków, has been leading his own trio since the beginning of his career, releasing his debut album "Yearning" in 2001. His subsequent albums, including "Piano Trio" (2006) and "Children's Episodes" (2009, Fresh Sound Records), have garnered critical acclaim and awards like a Fryderyk nomination. Known for blending traditional jazz with modern sensibilities, Wyleżoł has collaborated with international jazz luminaries like Gary Bartz, Billy Hart, and Nigel Kennedy.

## Kuba Więcek Trio

Saxophonist and composer Kuba Więcek leads this innovative trio, featuring Michał Barański (bass) and Łukasz Żyta (drums). Więcek made waves with his debut album "Another Raindrop," becoming the youngest artist ever featured in the prestigious Polish Jazz series. His second album, "Multitasking," earned him a spot on DownBeat Magazine's "25 For The Future" list. Educated across continents, Więcek blends influences from classical, folk, electronic, and hip-hop into his unique jazz vision. The trio has received numerous awards, including a Fryderyk (Polish Grammy), and represents the vibrant young generation of Polish jazz.
