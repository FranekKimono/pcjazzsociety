# About the Leaders

## Zbigniew Namysłowski (Saxophone)

A legendary figure in Polish jazz, Zbigniew Namysłowski is a renowned saxophonist, flautist, and composer born in Warsaw. He gained international recognition for his appearance on Krzysztof Komeda's seminal album "Astigmatic." Throughout his long and influential career, he has collaborated with numerous prominent Polish jazz artists, including Leszek Możdżer and Michał Urbaniak.

## Jacek Kochan (Drums)

A composer, arranger, and drummer originally from Krakow, Jacek Kochan studied music in Poland and Canada and is now based in Montreal. His dynamic drumming style combines melodic sensibilities with complex polyrhythms. As a prolific bandleader, Kochan is known for his original compositions that often explore odd meters and fuse elements of jazz with groove, hip-hop, and funk.

## The Quartet

This concert brought together these two giants of Polish jazz, complemented by the talents of pianist Paweł Tomaszewski and bassist Michał Kapczuk, for an unforgettable evening of high-caliber jazz performance.
