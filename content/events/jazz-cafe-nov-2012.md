# About the Featured Artist: Jesse Cahill

Jesse Cahill, a respected drummer on the Vancouver music scene, led the trio for this Jazz Café event alongside guitarist Oliver Gannon and bassist André Lachance.

Cahill is also known as the founder and leader of **The Nightcrawlers**, a Vancouver-based jazz ensemble formed in 2004 dedicated to preserving the sound and vibe of the great 1960s Hammond B3 organ bands. Inspired by icons like Brother Jack McDuff, Charles Earland, and Big John Patton, the Nightcrawlers play gritty, soulful music with authenticity and swinging authority.

The Nightcrawlers, often centered around the Hammond B-3 organ, typically feature a lineup including Chris Gestrin (organ), Dave Sikula (guitar), Cory Weeds (tenor sax), and Jack Duncan (percussion). They have released several acclaimed albums, including "Presenting" (nominated for Album of the Year at the 2009 National Jazz Awards), "Down in the Bottom," "Volume 3," "Do You Know A Good Thing?" and "Get Ready," often recorded live at Vancouver venues like The Cellar Nightclub and Frankie's Jazz Club.

Whether leading his trio or the Nightcrawlers, Jesse Cahill brings a deep sense of swing and tradition to his performances.
