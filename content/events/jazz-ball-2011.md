# About Evan Arntzen

Evan Arntzen is a Canadian-born clarinetist, saxophonist, vocalist, and educator now based in New York City. His uniquely expressive sound has been called "the very definition of timeless" by Grammy-winner Ricky Riccardi.

Raised in East Vancouver, Evan learned New Orleans-style clarinet from his grandfather, Lloyd Arntzen, at age seven. He later took up the tenor saxophone, studying with Stan Karp and Wojtek Komsta. Since moving to NYC in 2014, he has performed at prestigious venues like Jazz at Lincoln Center and major festivals including Newport and Monterey.

While leading various ensembles, his septet showcases his exploration of larger formats. His 2021 album "Countermelody" celebrates the soulful counterpoint of early New Orleans jazz. Evan has performed and recorded with numerous notable artists like Wycliffe Gordon, Ken Peplowski, and Catherine Russell, with whom he performs regularly.

Evan holds an MM in Jazz Performance from Manhattan School of Music and serves as the Artist Associate in Saxophone at Williams College.
