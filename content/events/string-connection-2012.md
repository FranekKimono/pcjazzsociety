# String Connection Live in Port Coquitlam (2012)

On March 23, 2012, the Terry Fox Theatre in Port Coquitlam hosted the iconic Polish jazz group, **String Connection**, presented by the Polish Canadian Jazz Society (PCJS). PCJS President Andrew Major and board member Tad Siedlaczek welcomed the audience and introduced the celebrated musicians.

## About String Connection

Led by violinist Krzesimir Dębski, String Connection emerged from Poznań in February 1981. Initially rooted in jazz-rock with folk influences, the band evolved towards a sophisticated smooth jazz sound, always emphasizing strong melodic playing. The core lineup solidified with Dębski, Krzysztof Przybyłowicz (drums), Andrzej Olejniczak (saxophone), Janusz Skowron (keyboards), and Krzysztof Ścierański (bass).

Dominating the Polish jazz scene in the early 80s, String Connection won numerous awards, including top honours at the Hoeilaart International Jazz Competition in Brussels (1983) and repeated first-place rankings in _Jazz Forum_ magazine polls (1982-1984). Dębski himself was lauded as musician and composer of the year. They toured extensively across Europe, North America, and the Soviet Union.

Known for their energetic performances, unique sound combinations, refined compositions, and great sense of humour, String Connection became leading figures of the "young power" movement in Polish jazz. After a hiatus during which Dębski focused on composing, the band reactivated, leading to tours and the "String Connection 2012" album, showcasing their enduring appeal.
